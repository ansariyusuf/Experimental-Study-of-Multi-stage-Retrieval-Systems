An Experimental Study of Multi-stage Retrieval Systems

Information Retrieval (IR) is concerned with searching over large unstructured data like web pages, emails, and image libraries, among others. This large-scale searching is made possible through IR systems, which pre-process and store such data in a space- and time-efficient structure known as an inverted index. In an IR system, the process of retrieving relevant data (referred, henceforth, to as documents) for a given user query passes through three major stages, namely: (1) candidate set generation, (2) feature extraction, and (3) candidate set re-ranking stages.

During the candidate set generation stage (or stage 1), a retrieval strategy with a pruning model (e.g., WAND and MaxScore) is executed on top of an inverted index to retrieve top-K ranked documents for any given user query. In the feature extraction stage (or stage 2), various features are extracted from the top-K documents generated by stage 1. In the candidate set re-ranking stage (or stage 3), the features extracted by stage 2 are dispatched to a trained machine learning model, which re-ranks the top-K documents accordingly. After re-ranking, the top 10-50 documents are output to the user as a final ranked list.

In this work, we discovered that the effectiveness of machine learning models in stage 3 relies heavily on the configuration parameters defined in stages 1 and 2. Nonetheless, these machine learning models are typically developed and trained in complete obliviousness to such parameters, yielding thereby a significant loss in end-to-end effectiveness of IR systems.

To this end, we thoroughly investigated the correlation between the different stages of real-world end-to-end multi-stage IR systems to understand how they impact each other and, accordingly, recoup lost effectiveness. In particular, we asked and answered two critical research questions. First, to what extent do stages 1 and 2 influence the effectiveness of stage 3? Second, what parameter values and machine learning models should we use in stages 1, 2, and 3 to achieve high effectiveness in end-to-end IR systems?

We answered the above two critical questions through a comprehensive experimental study that observed, identified, and explained the effectiveness of a representative search engine under various configuration parameters and machine learning models. Subsequently, we provided recommendations for improving the effectiveness of real-world IR systems and suggested promising research directions. 

In this thesis, we will comprehensively explore and analyze the correlation between the different stages of multi-stage IR Systems. In particular, we will ask and try to answer two major research questions. First, what are the effects of stages one and two on stage three? Said differently, which pruning techniques, ranking algorithms, and values of K in stage one and features in stage two are most impactful on stage three? As noted earlier, in stage three there are many machine learning algorithms for re-ranking top K documents. These algorithms will demonstrate different efficiencies and effectiveness based on the configurations of stages one and two. Consequently, it becomes essential to identify the optimal configurations of these two stages in order to maximize performance.
